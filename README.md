# luna-js

## Static Site Generation & SSR framework for customElements.

### Why?

The idea behind `luna-js` is to allow developers to rapidly create a fully fledged web application using customElements with support for server side rendering.

## Installation

luna-js should be installed as a npm dependency. To install luna-js run

`npm install @webtides/luna-js --save`

To get started with development, you should install the luna cli as a development dependency as well:

`npm install @webtides/luna-cli --save-dev`

## Getting started

After installing `luna-js` and the `luna-cli` as a dependency, you can simply run `luna --dev` to start your application in development mode. If this is the first time you have started `luna-js`, you will be asked if `luna-js` should generate a config file and a basic directory structure for you.

## luna-js concepts

`luna-js` uses the directory structure to automatically load the building blocks of your application.
